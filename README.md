Karasu is an anime streaming website that uses the [consumet](https://github.com/consumet/api.consumet.org) API, and runs ontop of express and ejs, with [redis](https://redis.io/) for caching. We are a fork of HaiKei

## Preview is live!

# What is this good for? 
Karasu is a streaming website that focuses on minimial loading times and an interface that is optimized for any device ðŸš€

# Why don't I just use 9anime or another alternative?

Karasu runs faster than a good majority of alternatives, is more lightweight, and is completely open source! Unlike Zoro and 9anime.

Karasu is still very actively maintained and looking for contributors! If you know javascript, especially NodeJS and server side work, feel free to make a contribution!
